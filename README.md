## Development Information

Note that the other services, when run locally, expect the frontend to be served on port 3000.

Set your environment with `export NODE_ENV=development`.
Run `npm install` to install all the node modules.

On React file changes, run `grunt` to build `frontend/react` and puts the files in `public/build`.

Run `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js` to run the file.
